# Rails::Crud::Tools

Welcome to Rails::Crud::Tools!   
This gem provides a tool to automatically update CRUD diagrams as you interact with your application.   
It simplifies logging and managing CRUD operations seamlessly within a Rails application.

## Installation

Add the gem to the `development` group in your application's Gemfile by including the following lines:

```ruby
gem 'rails-crud-tools'
```

Then execute:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

If you are not using Bundler, you can install the gem manually:

```sh
$ gem install rails-crud-tools
```

## Usage

### Setup
This command will generate the **doc/crud.xlsx** file and the **.crudconfig** file.

```sh
$ bundle exec crud init
```

.crudconfig
```yaml
enabled: true # Enables or disables the CRUD tools functionality
base_dir: doc # The base directory where the CRUD files will be stored
crud_file: crud.xlsx # The name of the CRUD Excel file
sheet_name: CRUD # The name of the sheet in the CRUD Excel file
method_col: Verb # Column indicating the HTTP method
action_col: Controller#Action # Column indicating the controller and action
table_start_col: your_first_table  # Column where the table starts
header_bg_color: 00FFCC # The background color for the header in the CRUD Excel file
sql_logging_enabled: true # Enables or disables SQL logging for CRUD operations
font_name: Arial # The font name used in the CRUD Excel file
```

### How It Works

Once integrated, the gem automatically tracks CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) performed in your application.   
The diagrams will update dynamically based on these operations, providing you with real-time insights into your application's data flow.

## Logs

Please refer to the log file at `log/crud.log`.

## CRUD Macro Workbook

The `tools/crud_macro.xlsm` file is a macro-enabled workbook used for manipulating CRUD diagrams.  
This workbook contains macros that help in managing and visualizing CRUD operations within your application.

You can also use `bin/console` for an interactive prompt to experiment with the gemâ€™s functionality.
